## coding-quiz

This coding Quiz was a challenge to code to say the least but im proud of the end results
the quiz consists of 5 questions worth 20 points each and you have a little over a minute to solve all the questions and getting questions wrong imposes a time penalty on you

## Challenges

This entire project was a challenge for me but it was well worth doing
javascript is a weakpoint for me and its nice to actually be able to do everything on this project and learn way more in depth about JS
a probelm in particular that i ran into was creating an array of rotating questions and then having to combine that with a for loop, another problem i found along the way was trying to hide or remove certain elements when different buttons were hit, The best solution i found was instead of removing the element entirely i could just change the elements class so it would be affected by CSS and hide its self.

## How to use

you can start the quiz by hitting the start button and youll be presented with a couple things, your current score, your remaining time, and a question. Answer the questions to the best of your abilities and you can see the score and time changing accordingly, for every correct question you get you will gain 20 points with a maximum of 100 points, for every wrong question you will recieve a penalty of 10 seconds. if the time runs out or you answer all 5 questions the game will end.
When the game ends you can input your initials and possibly be placed on the top score board, the board will display the initials and score of the highest scoring player, you can clear this score and retry by hitting clear high score and then try again
